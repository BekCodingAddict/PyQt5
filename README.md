Qt is a comprehensive framework for developing cross-platform applications that can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms.

  PyQt allows developers to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for their Python applications using Qt's powerful set of tools and libraries. It provides access to all the features and functionality of Qt, enabling developers to build robust and feature-rich applications with ease.

  PyQt consists of several modules that correspond to different aspects of Qt, such as QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, and others. These modules provide classes and functions that allow developers to create and manage windows, dialogs, buttons, menus, layouts, and other GUI elements. PyQt also includes support for multimedia, networking, databases, and more, making it a versatile toolkit for application development.

  PyQt is widely used in the Python community for developing desktop applications with sophisticated user interfaces. It combines the flexibility and ease of use of Python with the power and flexibility of the Qt framework, making it a popular choice for building cross-platform applications with rich graphical interfaces.
